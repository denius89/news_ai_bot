## How Cursor Loads These Rules

### Automatic Loading

1. **`.cursorrules`** (root level)
   - Loaded automatically on every Cursor session
   - Contains short, critical rules
   - ✅ Already created

2. **`.cursor/rules/*.mdc`** files
   - Loaded by Cursor as structured rules
   - Format: Markdown with frontmatter
   - Priority-based loading
   - ✅ Created: `30-env-backup-security.mdc`

### Files Created

```
.cursorrules                              ← Auto-loaded (short version)

## 🎯 What AI Will Do Now

When you ask to modify .env, AI will:

1. **ALWAYS suggest backup first:**
   ```
   💾 First, let's create a backup:
   env-save "description"
   ```

2. **Provide complete workflow:**
   ```
   env-save "before OpenAI key update"
   nano .env
   # Make changes...
   ```

3. **Remind about rollback:**
   ```
   If issues occur: env-restore
   ```

## 🔄 Testing the Integration

Try asking me (in next session):
- "Update OpenAI API key"
- "Change AI model settings"
- "How do I backup .env?"

I should ALWAYS respond with Git Stash workflow, NEVER suggest manual file copying.

## 📖 Priority System

Rules are numbered by priority:
- `00-*` - Highest priority (purpose/collaboration)
- `10-*` - Architecture
- `20-*` - Coding standards
- `30-*` - **Security/env management** ← NEW

Higher numbers = more specific rules

## ✅ Verification

To verify rules are loaded:
1. Close and reopen Cursor
2. Ask: "How should I backup .env?"
3. Expected: Git Stash workflow
4. Should NOT suggest: Manual file copying

**Status:** ✅ Configured and ready
**Next:** Restart Cursor to activate
